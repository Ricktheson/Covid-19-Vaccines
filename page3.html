                                                <p>Who is AstraZeneca?</p>
                                                <p> AztraZeneca plc is a British-Swedish multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology company with its headquarters at the Cambridge Biomedical Campus in Cambridge, England.
                                                    It is perhaps best known for its involvement in developing the Oxford-Astrazeneca COVID-19 vaccine. 
                                                    The company was founded in 1999 through the merger of the Swedish Astra AB and the British Zeneca Group. 
                                                    Since the merger it has been among the world's largest pharmaceutical companies.</p>
                                                <p> According to BBC, results from a long-awaited US trial of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine confirm that the shot is both safe and highly effective.</p>

                                        <p>So what is the efficacy of AstraZeneca vaccine?</p>
                                        <p> So far BBC news has confirmed that it has come up with trial results showing it to have stopped people from falling seriously ill with Covid-19,
                                            and identified no safety issues regarding blood clots among the 32,000 volunteers who took part.</p>

                                        <p>What about the bloodclot?</p>
                                        <p>Regulators have carried out a review into recent reports that a very small number of recently immunised people had suffered an extremely rare form of blood clot - cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT) - in the brain.
                                            In the UK, five cases of CSVT - one of them fatal - were recorded among 11 million people who received the vaccine. 
                                            The European Medicines Agency (EMA) received an additional 13 reports of CSVT. It can occur naturally and no link to the vaccine has been established.                                           
                                            Both the UK regulator and the EMA concluded that the vaccine is safe and there is no evidence that the vaccine causes clots.                                            
                                            As a precaution, regulators will continue to monitor the situation and advise symptoms, such as unusual bruising or persistent headache after vaccination, should prompt a medical check.                                            
                                            Covid infection can be serious and also make clots more likely.</p>

                                        <p>How does the AstraZeneca vaccine work?</p>
                                        <p>Part 1:</p>
                                        <p>A gene sample of the patient is taken:</p>
                                        <p>Scientists take genes for the spike protein on the surface of the Covid-19 virus and put them into a harmless irus to make a vaccine which them injected into the patient</p>

                                        <p>Part 2:</p>
                                        <p>The vaccine enters cells which then start to produce the spike protein. The body's immune system reacts, producing antibodies and actibates T-cells to destroy cells with the spike protein</p>

                                        <p>Part 3:</p>
                                        <p>If the patient later catches the covid-19 virus, antibodies and T-cells are triggered to fight the virus.</p>
